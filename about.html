        Hello! My name is Antonio I am currently studying to be a developer here
        in Canada. One of my main motivations to become a developer is the freedom
        you get of working remote. I am not the greatest but also not the
        worst. I have followed a lot of tutorials on youtube and Udemy and feel
        confident enough to read a code but not to build my own from scratch yet.
        The teach at my college has helped open my mind to the coding world and has 
        sent me in the right direction. JavaScript is my strongest ability in coding.
        I think I would like to try to be a frontend js developer. I currently have
        not worked as a developer but I am confident I can score a job at a start up
        company. Although my skills as a developer are not the best I have great critical
        thinking, analyzing, leadership, coordination, and people skills along with life 
        experience. With more practice I become a better developer. Thanks for taking the
         time to view my portfolio. Below is a picture of my Github
      </p>
